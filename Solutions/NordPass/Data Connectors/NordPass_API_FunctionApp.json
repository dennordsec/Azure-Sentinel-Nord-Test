Enter the **Workspace Name**, **Workspace Name**, **API Key**, and **URI**.\n - The default **Time Interval** is set to pull the last five (5) minutes of data. If the time interval needs to be modified, it is recommended to change the Function App Timer Trigger accordingly (in the function.json file, post deployment) to prevent overlapping data ingestion.\n - Note: If using Azure Key Vault secrets for any of the values above, use the`@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri={Security Identifier})`schema in place of the string values. Refer to [Key Vault references documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references) for further details. \n4.
